    "BACKSTORY": "Twiggle Brightstick Whistlethud was born into the industrious Whistlethud family of Brambleton Hollow, a snug gnome village nestled deep within the forest. The Whistlethuds were a well-respected clan of tinkerers, known for producing innovative tools, whimsical contraptions, and, occasionally, inventions that fizzled with a spectacular BOOM. Twiggle was the youngest of five siblings, each a budding inventor in their own right, and he was constantly trying to keep up with their latest creations, eager to prove himself as the most brilliant (or at least the most enthusiastic) of the Whistlethuds.\n\nTwiggle’s knack for building came early on, yet his little hands had a strange tendency to… fumble. He would nearly complete a mechanical owl, a clockwork automaton, or an enchanted contrivance, only to lose focus at the last second. More often than not, his workshop sounded like a festival of chaotic sounds: gears whirring out of control, magic crackling, and ka-booms followed by Twiggle’s high-pitched laugh. Villagers nicknamed him \"Twiggle Bangstick\" after one such incident involving an accidentally exploding toaster.\n\nOne day, while scrounging in the forest for some “extra sparkly rocks” for a project, Twiggle stumbled across the remains of an old, enchanted cannon, abandoned from some ancient skirmish. Intrigued by the powerful device, he dragged it back to his family’s workshop (after it accidentally fired, launching him into a pile of mud). It was that day that he found his true calling—artillery. The concept of creating devices that could be powerful and useful appealed to him instantly. He imagined himself as the protector of Brambleton, fending off threats with explosive precision (even if his precision left something to be desired).\n\nTwiggle devoted himself to learning the art of artificing, apprenticing under an older gnomish artillerist named Blinkwick Boombrace. Blinkwick was patient with Twiggle, recognizing that while his student was clumsy, he also had a natural gift for invention. Blinkwick introduced Twiggle to the intricacies of infusing magic into mechanical creations, teaching him the delicate balance of engineering and arcane energy. Twiggle’s zeal quickly grew, and his passion for arcane artillery became apparent to everyone around him.\n\nAfter a few years of mentorship, Twiggle struck out on his own as a fully-fledged Artillerist Artificer, determined to test his skills. He found that people tolerated his bumbling accidents because, more often than not, they ended in successful—if unintentional—victories. Twiggle once sent a small goblin raiding party fleeing in terror after an artillery turret he made “accidentally” exploded in a brilliant flash of fireworks. His clumsy, lucky success only fueled his self-confidence and fervor to travel and put his tinkering skills to real use.\n\nToday, Twiggle roams the world, lugging around a pack brimming with half-finished contraptions, spare gears, and magical infusions. He dreams of designing a masterpiece—a legendary cannon that no one will ever forget. Along the way, he collects spare parts, odd trinkets, and tall tales from fellow travelers. Though he’s far from perfect, Twiggle’s optimism and unshakable enthusiasm make him a welcome companion, even if his creations occasionally need to be handled with… caution.\n\nFor Twiggle Brightstick Whistlethud, each new day is a chance to build something extraordinary, blow something up, and learn from both in equal measure.",
